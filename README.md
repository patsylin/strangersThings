# Strangers Things

🛍️ A not-so-spooky online marketplace!
Strangers Things is a front-end React app that mimics Craigslist functionality, built using the Stranger's Things API from Fullstack Academy. The name is a play on _Stranger Things_ — but instead of monsters and Demogorgons, you'll find posts, messages, and tokens!

## 🌟 Purpose

This project was created to build comfort with React, API integration, token-based authentication, and conditional rendering—while having a little fun with naming along the way.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React
- **Routing:** React Router DOM
- **Styling:** CSS
- **Auth:** Token-based authentication
- **API:** Stranger's Things REST API

## ✨ Features

- 📝 **Browse all marketplace listings** — see every post in the system, even if you’re not logged in.
- 🔐 **Register and log in** — secure token-based authentication.
- 🛍️ **Create, edit, and delete your own posts** — manage your listings with ease.
- 💬 **Send messages to other users** — contact sellers directly from their posts.
- 🚦 **Dynamic UI** — interface changes automatically based on login state.
