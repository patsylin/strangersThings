# Strangers Things

🛍️ A not-so-spooky online marketplace!  
Strangers Things is a front-end React app that mimics Craigslist functionality, built using the Stranger's Things API from Fullstack Academy. The name is a play on *Stranger Things* — but instead of monsters and Demogorgons, you'll find posts, messages, and tokens!
